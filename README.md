# Unity-Gravity-Physics-Manipulation
A game where you can use "time travel" and a gravity gun to solve basic puzzles. A simple proof of concept.

The scripts found here are specifically for the gravity gun and objects which can be manipulated, as they operate independent from other game functionality.
A playable version of the game can be found here:
